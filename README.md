## Welcome to my Github Portfolio

I am an aspiring Data Scientist, currently pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science at the Asian Institute of Management

The accuracy is measured by how close the LSTM prediction is to the true breakdown. Machine Health is monitored with the help of multiple sensors and a potential failure curve is fit. The project uses the [Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan).|

We used a total of 100 images and built on existing face recognition models such as MTCNN and Facenet for the classification. |

I used non-linear programming to find the efficient frontier for each segment based on the risk (of default), competitor rates, duration of loan, etc. to maximize the overall profit.|

6. Recommender System - [Recommender System for LastFM music.](https://github.com/nisnig/Recommender-system-LastFM)
7. Simple ML - [Indicators of Fake Job Posts.](https://github.com/May-nerd/ml1-final-project)
8. Information Retrieval - [A modified search engine for bills in the Philippines Congress Website.](https://github.com/May-nerd/dmw-ml-final-project)

*Note: Due to the size of the jupyter notebooks, you may be required to download them to view.
