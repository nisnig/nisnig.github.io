This page collects all the projects I worked on during my MSc Data Science at the Asian Institute of Management, Makati, Philippines.

I graduated in 2021 and subsequently worked as a data scientist. Following are the projects I worked on during my program. 

### Project Highlights

The accuracy is measured by how close the LSTM prediction is to the true breakdown. Machine Health is monitored with the help of multiple sensors and a potential failure curve is fit. The project uses the [Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan).|

We used a total of 100 images and built on existing face recognition models such as MTCNN and Facenet for the classification. The project may be used for security measures in organizations.|

I used non-linear programming to find the efficient frontier for each segment based on the risk of default, competitor rates, duration of loan, etc. to maximize the overall profit, resulting in a 100% increase.|

Some of the other projects I have worked on are:
1. Geospatial analysis - [Metro Manila Road Networks and their proximity to Emergency services](https://github.com/nisnig/Manila-Roads-Geospatial-Analysis)
2. Network Analysis - [Philippine Senators Collaboration Network](https://github.com/nisnig/Philippine-Senator-Collaboration-Network)
3. Time Series Analysis - [M5 Time Series Prediction](https://github.com/nisnig/M5-Time-series-predictions)
4. Natural Language Processing - [Homophily Analysis of Tweets in the US 2020 Elections.](https://github.com/nisnig/Homophily-Analysis-of-Tweets)
5. Image Processing - [American Sign Language (alphabets only) Live recognition using CNN.](https://github.com/nisnig/ASL-Recognition)
6. Stock Prediction - [Bitcoin Behaviour Prediction using GDELT news articles w/ Dask & S3](https://github.com/nisnig/Bitcoin-Fluctuation-Prediction-with-GDELT-News)
7. Stock Prediction - [European Stock Behavior Prediction w/ pyspark & AWS EMR.](https://github.com/nisnig/Eurostock-Prediction)
8. Data Visualization - [Air Quality Visualization in China (Pre-During the Pandemic) w/ Dask, AWS EC2, & S3.](https://github.com/nisnig/Air-Quality-trend-visualization)
9. Recommender System - [Recommender System for LastFM music.](https://github.com/nisnig/Recommender-system-LastFM)
10. Simple ML - [Indicators of Fake Job Posts.](https://github.com/May-nerd/ml1-final-project)
11. Information Retrieval - [A modified search engine for bills in the Philippines Congress Website.](https://github.com/May-nerd/dmw-ml-final-project)

*Note: Due to the size of the jupyter notebooks, you may be required to download them to view.*

12. I also made several blog posts for begineer level computer vision and image processing techniques for data science in [Medium](https://nisnig.medium.com/)
